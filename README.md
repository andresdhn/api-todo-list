## API To-Do List

This is your classic To-Do list, but made in React with Hooks, and Bootstrap 4 and pre-populated with an REAST API.

Inpiration for API ToDo List came from a coding test I sat through a while ago. The task consisted in creating a API fed to-do's list in less than 60m. Now passed, I've decided to complete this project as a public stable version using latest modern approaches.

I use [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to Feed the initial list with mock-up data. I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick integration for testing, works pretty well in my opinion.
