## API fed To-Do List

Recently I was task to build this project in 60m, so I decided to complete it and give it my own twist using 
flexbox Sass and an Rest API integration to Feed the initial component Monunt. 

Public API I used is: 
[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

I recommend this to anyone who needs a quick integration for testing, worked pretty well.
