## API fed To-Do List

Recently I was task to build this project in 60m, so I've decided to extend it by giving it my own twist using 
flexbox Sass and a Rest API integration to Feed the initial Component mount. 

The public API I used is: 
[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick integration for testing, worked pretty well in my opinion.
