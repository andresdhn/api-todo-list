## API To-Do List

Inpiration for API ToDo List came from a codign test I performed a while ago. The task consisted in creating a API fed to do's list in less than 60m. Now passed, I've decided to complete this project an publish a stable version using latest modern approaches.

I use [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to Feed the initial list with mock-up data. I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick integration for testing, works pretty well in my opinion.
